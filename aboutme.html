                        <th style="font-size:25px"><u>Career Goal:</u><br><br>My name is Kyle Handova, and I am a junior at Palm Desert High School. I have always has a love or an interest in some type of engineering or computer science. As a kid I remember I would draw little "blue prints" of a floating car using magnets. Anyway, I would love to work in some kind of engineering or Information Technology profession. Im working my hardest to acheive that by joining both the enginerring & computer science pathways.

                            Strengths & Personal Qualities:</u><br><br>
                            One of my strongest strengths I would say would be, I am adaptable and quick. For example, I play baseball, and not only do I only have about a blink of an eye to know if I should swing or not, I also have to know where the ball is going to end up and make contact with the ball. Another Strength of mine would have to be, that I am flexible. We all know what is happening in the 2020-2021 school year, and it is important to be flexible and be able to change the way you do things and still be successful.
