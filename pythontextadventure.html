            I had come accross multiple problems during the coding proccess or this text adventure project. One being that I had to figure why my print functions were bugging out and overlapping eachother. Luckily this problem was just due to the size of the terminal. I easily fixed this problem by giving each sentence a new print function to space them out. Another problem I was faced with was the fact that if anything was misspelled or out of place by just a space or semi-colen, everything would stop working. I spent lots of time making sure that everything was spelling and put into the correct place. All in all the project went pretty smooth after I got the hang of coding in python. Here was my end result!
